CONCEPTS TO USE:
[ ] Randomness:
      - to determine the value of the currency
      - suggest a random password to the user when signing up
[X] Symmetric Encryption (AES):
      - transactions will have an additional field: reason, that will be encrypted.
        => only sender and receiver of this transaction can see it
[X] Hash Functions:
      - Block hashes
      - Store passwords

FEATURES:
  - DONE:
    - create blocks
    - create blockchain
    - create proof of work
    - create transactions
    - create users:
        - signup
        - login 
    - Introduce mining rewards  
    - Calculate user balance
    - Deny overspending transactions
    - Giving initial reward to new users
    - Extra verifications
        - verify chain function: check that previous hashes are consistent
        - verify block integrity and validity when adding it to the chain (hash starts with 000..) (see example projects)

  - TO IMPLEMENT:
    PRIORITY:
    - Document/Comment
    - Check for todos around the project
    - Add validation for inputs

    FUTURE:
    - Sign Transactions
        - digital signatures with private-public key
        - include a transaction id
    - Introduce Wallets:
        - wallet address for transactions or rewards
    - Decentralization/Distribution
        - every user has its own copy of the blockchain (can be stored on files with the name/id of the user)
          when an user performs a transaction should add it to its own blockchain and then broadcast it to 
          everyone else
        - multi-user support: multiple terminals running the application can be opened at the same time
    - Simulate errors when trying to corrupt data
    - Keep user logged in
    - Better error handling in cli input:
        - username, password: must be longer tha tot characters
    - Persist blockchain (saving it in a file)

CODING FEATURES/OPTIMIZATIONS
- don't store key in aes cipher, but pass key to decrypt method?
- Make userDB a singleton
- cache the file as an attribute inside users_db
- userDB:
  - drop
  - ...
  - don't keep db attribute but open file every time?
- user @property on block to recompute hash every time something changes?
